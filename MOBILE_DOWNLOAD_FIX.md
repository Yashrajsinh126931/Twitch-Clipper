## Issue Resolution: Downloading Clips on Mobile Devices

The application has been updated to better support downloading clips on mobile devices. Here's what was fixed and how it now works:

### What Was Fixed

1. **Missing API Route**: The iOS-specific download route `/api/clipDownload` was missing, causing download failures on mobile devices.

2. **Better Mobile Detection**: Improved detection of mobile devices and browsers to provide appropriate download methods.

3. **Multiple Download Strategies**: Different download approaches for different device types:
    - **Mobile devices**: Uses iframe-based downloads and streaming with proper headers
    - **Desktop Safari**: Uses redirect approach
    - **Other desktop browsers**: Uses blob-based downloads

### New Mobile Download Features

1. **Mobile-Optimized Endpoint**: `/api/mobileDownload` - Streams video with proper download headers
2. **iOS-Compatible Endpoint**: `/api/clipDownload` - Redirects to video URL for iOS devices
3. **User Feedback**: Shows messages to mobile users about download status
4. **Fallback Methods**: Multiple fallback options if one method fails

### How Mobile Downloads Work Now

#### For Mobile Devices (Android/iOS):

1. User clicks download button
2. System detects mobile device
3. Creates hidden iframe that loads the mobile download endpoint
4. Endpoint streams video with `Content-Disposition: attachment` header
5. Mobile browser handles the download according to device capabilities
6. User gets feedback message about download status

#### For iOS Specifically:

1. Uses GET request to `/api/clipDownload`
2. Endpoint sets download headers and redirects to video URL
3. iOS Safari handles the video according to its download policies

### User Instructions for Mobile

When using the app on mobile devices:

1. **Download Button**: Tap the download button on any clip
2. **Check Downloads**: Look in your device's Downloads folder or browser downloads
3. **Alternative**: If download doesn't work, use the "Watch" button to view the video and use your browser's built-in save/download options
4. **iOS Users**: You may need to long-press the video after clicking "Watch" and select "Save Video" from the menu

### Technical Details

The mobile download system now includes:

-   **Content-Disposition headers** for proper filename handling
-   **Iframe-based downloads** for mobile compatibility
-   **Streaming with proper MIME types** (video/mp4)
-   **Error handling and fallbacks**
-   **User feedback messages**

### Troubleshooting

If downloads still don't work:

1. **Check browser permissions** - Ensure downloads are enabled
2. **Try different browsers** - Some mobile browsers handle downloads differently
3. **Use "Watch" button** - As an alternative, open the video and save manually
4. **Check device storage** - Ensure enough space is available

The system should now work reliably across all mobile devices and browsers.
